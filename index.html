     <!--To Hack Your Future and class 14; all of this is new to me. 
        I may not be the best or the more gifted, or a super fast learner lol 
        but I have the drive to learn and have success. 
        I want to be succesful, please allow me to be part of your course. I will tell you all a joke:
        Q: What did Cinderella say when her photos did not show up?
        A: Some day my prints will come! LOL
        Thank you...Alejandra-->
